# Titanic-project
Titanic survival prediction using Python and machine learning. Includes EDA, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

Objectives:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categories)
- Build and evaluate classification models
- Interpret key features influencing survival

Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

 Outcome:
A classification model capable of predicting survival with good accuracy, plus visual insights into the dataset.
